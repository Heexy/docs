# The foundation of Heexy maps 

Heexy Maps are built using data from many sources, with **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** as the foundation. These sources combine to create Heexy Maps with our own unique design and style.

## 🗺️ Key features:

- 🛡️ **Privacy-first approach** — Heexy Maps are designed to keep your data private, ensuring no third parties have access to user information.  
- 🔧 **Custom infrastructure goal** — We aim to develop as much of our own infrastructure as possible, reducing reliance on external services.  
- ⭐ **Heexy Reviews integration** — Our map reviews system is fully built in-house, with plans to add many more native features in the future.  

Our long-term goal is to offer a complete, privacy-respecting map experience powered primarily by Heexy's own technology and systems.
