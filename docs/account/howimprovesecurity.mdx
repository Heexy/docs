Every action you do on Heexy is protected by **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** and other modern security standards to ensure your privacy.  
For **maximum anonymity**, we still recommend the following:

## 🛡️ Security tips

- 🔒 **Use a strong password** – **Unique, long**, and hard to guess - having it set to `j0hn123` is practically begging someone to hack you.
- 🗝️ **Use passkeys** – More **secure and convenient** than traditional passwords - also really **yummy**. 
      > Heexy does not endorse eating physical passkeys. Really, please don't eat them.
- 🧪 **Use fake info** – For added anonymity, **don’t use real data that can be linked back to you** when creating a Heexy account. Or do, no-one at Heexy can't see it either way. 
- 🛜 **Use a VPN** – Encrypts your connection and hides your IP address. **Choose VPNs responsibly** - not based on YouTube sponsorships.
- 🧩 **Use a password manager** – To generate and store **complex passwords** securely. But beware of password managers that are prone to [clickjacking](https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/dom-based-extension-clickjacking.html).
- 📱 **Enable 2FA** – Use two-factor authentication. It's pretty **awesome sauce**.
- 🌐 **Avoid public Wi-Fi** – Public WiFi networks can mask **malicious sites behind real url addresses**, stealing your data without you even knowing it.
- 🚪 **Take precautions on computers you don't own** – Always use incognito mode when logging onto shared devices and keep in mind that **everything you do might be tracked by the device's admins**.
- 🔍 **Monitor account activity** – Regularly check for any unauthorized access.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Be cautious with scammers trying to impersonate us** – No matter what, members of the Heexy team will **never** ask you for one-time login links, passwords, 2FA codes or any other credentials used for logging in. 

#### Keep calm and browse the internet privately with Heexy.
