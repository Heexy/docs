# Improve Account Security?

Heexy is protected by **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** and other modern security standards to ensure your privacy.  
For **maximum anonymity**, we still recommend the following:

## 🛡️ Tips for Better Security

- 🔒 **Use a strong password** – Unique, long, and hard to guess.
- 🗝️ **Use passkeys** – More secure and convenient than traditional passwords.
- 🧪 **Use fake info** – For added anonymity, don’t use real names or data in your account.
- 🛜 **Use a VPN** – Encrypts your connection and hides your IP address.
- 🧩 **Use a password manager** – To generate and store complex passwords securely.
- 📱 **Enable 2FA** – Use two-factor authentication if available.
- 🌐 **Avoid public Wi-Fi** – Especially when accessing your account.
- 🚪 **Log out when done** – Especially on shared devices.
- 🔍 **Monitor account activity** – Regularly check for any unauthorized access
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Be cautious with links** – Avoid clicking on suspicious links or emails or downloading anything
