# Supported languages

Heexy aims to be available to as many users across the world. A big part of this is having Heexy services available in their native tongue. \
We're actively looking to extend to as many languages as we can, but finding native speakers isn't easy. If you're a native speaker of any language that we currently don't fully support, don't be afraid to [reach out](https://docs.heexy.org/contact)!

## Here is a list of all supported languages:

| Language | Code | Status |
